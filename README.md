# Splunk SIEM Project: DNS Log Analysis & Risk-Based Alerting with MITRE ATT&CK


## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to use Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) and Splunk Security Essentials (SSE) to perform two critical security functions:

â€¢ Analyzing DNS Logs â€“ Detecting anomalies, suspicious queries, and potential malicious domains.
â€¢ Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) with MITRE ATT&CK Mapping â€“ Assigning risk scores to attacker techniques such as PowerShell, Mimikatz, and WMIexec, and aligning detections with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

These exercises showcase SIEM configuration, log analysis, and adversary detection workflows that SOC analysts use in real-world environments.

## ðŸ”Ž DNS Log Analysis in Splunk

### 1. Search DNS Events
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample
```

### ðŸ”¹ Search DNS Events

### 2. Extract Relevant Fields Using Regex
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | regex _raw="(?i)\\b(dns|domain|query|response|port 53)\\b"
```

### 3. Identify Anomalies (Query Spikes)
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | stats count by fqdn
```

### 4. Top Queried Domains and Source IPs
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample | top fqdn, src_ip
```

### 5. Investigate Suspicious Domains
```spl
index=* sourcetype=dns_sample fqdn="maliciousdomain.com"
```

## Part 2: Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) with MITRE ATT&CK

## Step 1: Build Custom RBA Detections

Correlation searches were created in Splunk SSE with added risk scoring fields:

### 2. Extract Relevant Fields Using Regex
```spl
index=windows EventCode=4104
| eval risk_object=user
| eval risk_score=20
| eval mitre_technique="T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter"
| table _time, user, host, risk_object, risk_score, mitre_technique
```

Examples configured:

â€¢ PowerShell Execution (T1059) â†’ risk_score=20
â€¢ Credential Dumping â€“ Mimikatz (T1003) â†’ risk_score=30
â€¢ Remote Execution â€“ WMIexec (T1047) â†’ risk_score=40
â€¢ High-Risk User Alert (score â‰¥ 60)

## Step 2: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Each detection was mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques for adversary emulation.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework

| Technique ID | Technique Name                    | Tactic            | Status  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| T1059        | Command and Scripting Interpreter | Execution         | Covered |
| T1003        | Credential Dumping (Mimikatz)     | Credential Access | Covered |
| T1047        | WMIexec                           | Lateral Movement  | Covered |

## Step 3: Coverage Analysis
Using the MITRE ATT&CK Benchmark dashboard, I validated coverage and visualized detection alignment.

â€¢ 10 Techniques selected
â€¢ Coverage shown via potential detections
â€¢ Identified improvements for better coverage


## Step 4: Security Essentials Overview
The SSE Overview Dashboard provided high-level visibility:
â€¢ of datasources configured
â€¢ of detections created
â€¢ Top MITRE ATT&CK tactics covered
â€¢ Use cases by Security Data Journey
